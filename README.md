Meandering River Dynamics and Storage Time
This repository was created by Tobias Hasse (tobiack@udel.edu) to host source code related to my thesis research.

The overall structure of this code is to run my Fork of Jon Schwenk's Life Of a Meander Bend (LOMB) code to generate a Simulation of the Long-Term Evolution of a Meandering River, then take that simulation output to place synthetic sediment deposits adjacent to the river and track the amount of time those sediments have remained in storage when they are subsequently eroded

A package of code files will be added to this repository at a later time.
